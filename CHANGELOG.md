### Usage Examples

#### Start MCP Server
```bash
# Default settings (localhost:8080)
rosetta-ruchy-mcp

# Custom configuration  
rosetta-ruchy-mcp --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --ruchy-path /usr/local/bin/ruchy
```

#### Claude Code Integration
```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "rosetta-ruchy-translator": {
      "command": "rosetta-ruchy-mcp",
      "capabilities": ["code_translation", "formal_verification", "performance_analysis"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Translation API Usage
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_code": "def fibonacci(n): return n if n <= 1 else fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
    "source_language": "python",
    "options": {"verify": true, "optimize": true}
  }'
```
