## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Test Coverage Enhancement Pattern
```ruchy
// Enhanced test structure for each domain
module tests {
    use framework::ruchy_test::*;
    use crate::*;
    
    // Unit tests with 80% coverage requirement
    #[test_coverage(target = 80)]
    #[mutation_testing(threshold = 85)]
    fun test_comprehensive_functionality() {
        // Property-based testing
        property_test!(
            |input: ValidInput| verify_algorithm_correctness(input)
        );
        
        // Edge case testing
        test_edge_cases();
        
        // Performance regression testing
        benchmark_performance_baseline();
        
        // Error path testing
        test_error_handling();
    }
    
    // Integration tests
    #[integration_test]
    fun test_end_to_end_scenarios() {
        // Real-world usage patterns
    }
    
    // Performance tests
    #[performance_test(baseline = "performance_baseline.json")]
    fun benchmark_critical_paths() {
        // Automated performance regression detection
    }
}
```

### PMAT Measurement Integration
```ruchy
// Automated quality assessment
fun measure_pmat_scores(domain: Domain) -> PMATScores {
    let provability = ruchy::provability(&domain.files);
    let maintainability = analyze_maintainability(&domain.files);
    let accuracy = verify_accuracy(&domain.tests);
    let testability = measure_test_coverage(&domain.files);
    
    PMATScores {
        provability_score: provability.score,
        maintainability_score: maintainability.score,
        accuracy_score: accuracy.score,
        testability_score: testability.coverage_percentage
    }
}
```
