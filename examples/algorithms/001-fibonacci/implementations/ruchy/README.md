# Ruchy Fibonacci Implementation

## About Ruchy

Ruchy is a hypothetical programming language designed for the Rosetta Ruchy benchmark suite. It aims to demonstrate:

- Performance parity with Rust
- Ergonomics similar to Python
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without garbage collection

## Implementation Notes

This implementation serves as a reference for what Ruchy code would look like, combining:

- Rust-like syntax and type system
- Python-like simplicity and readability
- Built-in benchmarking and testing support
- First-class support for functional and imperative paradigms

## Running

Since Ruchy is a hypothetical language, this implementation cannot be executed directly. The syntax and structure are provided for documentation and comparison purposes.

## Expected Performance

Based on the design goals, Ruchy implementations should:

- Match Rust performance within 5% for CPU-bound tasks
- Use comparable memory to Rust (Â±10%)
- Compile faster than Rust for incremental builds
- Provide better error messages than typical systems languages
