# Algorithm 004: Binary Search

**Hypothesis**: Ruchy can prove O(log n) search complexity and termination guarantees

## Problem Statement

Implement Binary Search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array using divide-and-conquer approach, achieving logarithmic time complexity.

## Algorithm Properties

### Time Complexity
- **Best Case**: O(1) - Target found at middle position
- **Average Case**: O(log n) - Target found after logarithmic divisions
- **Worst Case**: O(log n) - Target not found or at extremes

### Space Complexity
- **Iterative**: O(1) - Constant space
- **Recursive**: O(log n) - Recursion stack depth

## Success Criteria

### Scientific Validation
- [ ] Ruchy correctly identifies O(log n) complexity
- [ ] Formal verification confirms termination guarantees
- [ ] Quality score achieves A grade (â‰¥0.95)
