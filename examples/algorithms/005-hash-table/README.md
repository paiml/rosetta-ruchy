# Algorithm 005: Hash Table

**Hypothesis**: Ruchy can prove O(1) average case operations and collision handling

## Problem Statement

Implement a Hash Table data structure with key-value storage, demonstrating O(1) average-case performance for insert, lookup, and delete operations using collision resolution techniques.

## Algorithm Properties

### Time Complexity
- **Insert**: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (with collisions)
- **Lookup**: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (with collisions) 
- **Delete**: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case (with collisions)

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)** - Linear space for n key-value pairs

## Key Features
- Hash function implementation
- Collision resolution (chaining or open addressing)
- Load factor management
- Resize/rehashing capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Scientific Validation
- [ ] Ruchy correctly identifies O(1) average complexity
- [ ] Formal verification of hash function properties
- [ ] Quality score achieves A grade (â‰¥0.95)
