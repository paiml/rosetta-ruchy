# Algorithm 003: Mergesort

**Hypothesis**: Ruchy can prove stable sorting with guaranteed O(n log n) complexity

## Problem Statement

Implement the Mergesort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all cases and maintains stability (equal elements preserve their relative order).

## Success Criteria

### Scientific Validation
- [ ] Ruchy correctly identifies O(n log n) complexity
- [ ] Formal verification confirms stability properties  
- [ ] Quality score achieves A grade (â‰¥0.95)
