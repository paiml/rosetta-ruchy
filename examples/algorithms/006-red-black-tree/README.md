# Algorithm 006: Red-Black Tree (Simplified)

**Hypothesis**: Ruchy can prove tree invariants and O(log n) operations

## Problem Statement

Implement a simplified Red-Black Tree data structure demonstrating balanced tree properties, O(log n) time complexity for operations, and formal verification of tree invariants.

## Algorithm Properties

### Time Complexity
- **Insert**: O(log n) - Guaranteed balanced tree height
- **Search**: O(log n) - Logarithmic tree traversal
- **Delete**: O(log n) - Rebalancing maintains height

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)** - Linear space for n nodes

## Key Features
- Tree structure with color properties
- Balance invariant verification
- Height analysis for performance guarantees
- Tree traversal algorithms

## Success Criteria

### Scientific Validation
- [ ] Ruchy correctly identifies O(log n) complexity
- [ ] Formal verification of tree invariants
- [ ] Quality score achieves A grade (â‰¥0.95)
