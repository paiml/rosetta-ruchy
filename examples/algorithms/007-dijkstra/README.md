# Algorithm 007: Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Hypothesis**: Ruchy can prove shortest path correctness and O((V + E) log V) complexity

## Problem Statement

Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

## Algorithm Properties

### Time Complexity
- **O((V + E) log V)** - Using priority queue with V vertices and E edges
- **O(V²)** - Using simple array implementation

### Space Complexity
- **O(V)** - Distance array and visited set

## Key Features
- Graph representation
- Priority queue simulation
- Shortest path calculation
- Path reconstruction

## Success Criteria

### Scientific Validation
- [ ] Ruchy correctly identifies graph algorithm complexity
- [ ] Formal verification of shortest path properties
- [ ] Quality score achieves A grade (e0.95)
