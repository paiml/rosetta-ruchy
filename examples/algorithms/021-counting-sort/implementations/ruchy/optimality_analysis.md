# Counting Sort Optimality Analysis

## Generated by `ruchy optimal counting_sort.ruchy --compare-theoretical`

### Time Complexity Optimality

**Status: ✅ OPTIMAL**

**Analysis:**
- **Lower Bound:** Ω(n + k) 
  - Must examine each of n input elements at least once → Ω(n)
  - Must initialize range of k possible values → Ω(k)  
  - Combined: Ω(n + k)

- **Upper Bound:** O(n + k)
  - Our implementation achieves exactly O(n + k) operations
  - No asymptotically faster algorithm exists for this problem

- **Conclusion:** Time complexity is asymptotically optimal

### Space Complexity Analysis  

**Status: ⚠️ SUBOPTIMAL (with tradeoffs)**

**Current Implementation:** O(n + k)
- Counting array: O(k) space
- Output array: O(n) space  
- Total auxiliary space: O(n + k)

**Possible Improvements:**
1. **In-place variant:** O(k) space
   - Eliminate output array by modifying input in-place
   - **Tradeoff:** Loses stability property
   - **Use case:** When stability not required

2. **Compressed counting:** O(min(k, n)) space  
   - Use hash map for sparse ranges
   - **Tradeoff:** Increases time complexity to O(n log k) in worst case
   - **Use case:** When k >> n and range is sparse

### Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space | Stable | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Counting Sort** | **O(n + k)** | **O(n + k)** | **✅** | **Optimal for small k** |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) avg | O(log n) | ❌ | General purpose |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) | ✅ | Consistent performance |
| Radix Sort | O(d(n + k)) | O(n + k) | ✅ | For multi-digit numbers |
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(1) | ❌ | In-place guarantee |

### When Counting Sort is Optimal

**Use Counting Sort when:**
- `k ≤ O(n)` - Range is not significantly larger than input size
- `k ≤ O(n log n)` - Still faster than comparison-based sorts  
- Stability required and k is reasonable
- Integer inputs with known range

**Avoid when:**
- `k >> n log n` - Space and time become prohibitive
- Floating-point inputs (use bucket sort instead)
- Memory is severely constrained (use in-place comparison sort)

### Theoretical Impossibility Results

**What's impossible to improve:**
1. **Time below O(n + k):** Must touch each input element (n) and initialize range (k)
2. **Stable sort with O(1) space:** Proven impossible for counting-based algorithms
3. **General comparison-free sorting:** Counting sort only works for bounded integer ranges
