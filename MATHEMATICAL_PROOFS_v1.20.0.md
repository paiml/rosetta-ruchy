// Maintaining correctness through iteration
// Invariant: curr = F(i), prev = F(i-1)
```

### 3. Recurrence Relations
```ruchy
// Proving F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) holds
assert(fn == fn_minus_1 + fn_minus_2);
```

### 4. Complexity Bounds
```ruchy
// Documented time/space complexity with proof sketches

## 📋 Migration Guide

### Converting Existing Algorithms

#### Before (v1.18.x):
```ruchy
fun fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 { n }
    else { fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) }
}
```

#### After (v1.20.0 with proofs):
```ruchy
fn fibonacci(n) {
    // Property: Base cases
    if n == 0 { 0 }  // F(0) = 0
    else if n == 1 { 1 }  // F(1) = 1
    else {
        // Property: Recurrence relation
        // F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
        fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    }
}

// Verification function
fn verify_fibonacci() {
    assert(fibonacci(0) == 0, "Base case F(0)");
    assert(fibonacci(1) == 1, "Base case F(1)");
    // More properties...
}
```
