## Architecture Established

### Workflow Triggers

**Daily Validation**:
- decy and bashrs run daily at 6am UTC
- Triggered on code changes to Tier 0 implementations
- Manual trigger available via workflow_dispatch

**Weekly Performance**:
- Runs Sunday at 6am UTC
- Manual trigger with baseline_only option

**Issue Automation**:
- Triggered on validation workflow completion
- Runs for both success and failure cases

### Matrix Strategy

All validation workflows use matrix strategy for parallel execution:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    algorithm:
      - 001-fibonacci
      - 004-binary-search
      - 022-selection-sort
      - 021-counting-sort
      - 002-quicksort
      - 003-mergesort
      - 018-heap-sort
      - 019-radix-sort
```

**Benefits**:
- 8x faster execution (parallel vs sequential)
- Independent algorithm testing
- Isolated failure investigation
- Comprehensive coverage

### Artifact Management

**Validation Artifacts** (per algorithm):
- Transpiled source code
- Compilation logs
- Test outputs
- Benchmark results
- Correctness diffs
- Validation reports

**Performance Artifacts**:
- Baseline JSON files (per algorithm, per metric)
- Performance reports
- Regression analysis
- 90-day retention

### Quality Gates

**Transpilation**: Must succeed without errors
**Compilation**: Generated Rust must compile
**Testing**: All tests must pass
**Correctness**: Output must match reference
**Performance**: Must be within reasonable bounds (tracked but not blocking)
**Safety**: Unsafe blocks tracked (decy), POSIX compliance tracked (bashrs)

});
```

**Benefit**: Clean issue tracker, focused triage

### 2. Bidirectional Validation (bashrs)

```
Original Bash → Transpile → Rust → Purify → Bash
     ↓                                        ↓

### Challenges Overcome

1. **decy Installation**: Required cloning from source and installing LLVM dependencies
   - Solution: Comprehensive installation steps in workflow

2. **Performance Baseline Comparison**: Needed artifact download across workflow runs
   - Solution: Used artifact download action with run IDs

   - Solution: Used continue-on-error and tracked results separately

4. **Regression Threshold**: Determining appropriate threshold (10%)
   - Solution: Made configurable, can adjust based on transpiler maturity

### Best Practices Established

1. **Artifact Naming**: Use descriptive names with algorithm and transpiler
2. **Continue-on-Error**: Use for non-blocking stages to maximize information
