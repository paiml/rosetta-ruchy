summary: |
  The Ruchy toolchain shows promise but has significant discrepancies between its documentation and actual behavior.
  While basic syntax checking, testing, and scoring appear to function, core features like compilation and advanced analysis tools are either broken or provide incomplete information.
  The documentation, which I'm referring to as "the book", is outdated and does not reflect the current state of the toolchain, leading to a confusing and frustrating user experience.
  The highest priority should be to fix the compilation issues and update the documentation to be accurate.

suggestions:
  - Prioritize fixing the `ruchy compile` command, as it is a critical feature for a compiled language.
  - Update the documentation (especially README.md, COMPILATION_GUIDE.md, DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md) to reflect the actual output and behavior of the `ruchy` toolchain. Remove or mark features that are not implemented or not working.
  - Improve the output of `ruchy runtime` and `ruchy provability` to provide the detailed metrics shown in the documentation.
  - Investigate the discrepancies in `ruchy provability` scores. A score of 0 for a simple fibonacci implementation seems incorrect.
  - Create a CI job that runs the documentation examples to ensure they remain valid as the toolchain evolves.

working_features:
  - feature:
      name: ruchy check
      description: Validates the syntax of .ruchy files.
      status: working
      notes: Successfully identifies valid syntax.
  - feature:
      name: ruchy score
      description: Calculates a quality score for .ruchy files.
      status: working
      notes: Provides a score as expected.
  - feature:
      name: ruchy test
      description: Runs test files.
      status: working
      notes: Successfully executes tests and reports results.

broken_features:
  - feature:
      name: ruchy compile
      description: Compiles .ruchy files to native executables.
      status: broken
      notes: Fails to compile a basic, documented "working" example.
  - feature:
      name: ruchy runtime
      description: Analyzes runtime complexity.
      status: partially_working
      notes: The command runs but provides minimal, unhelpful output compared to the documentation.
  - feature:
      name: ruchy provability
      description: Analyzes the provability of code.
      status: questionable
      notes: Gives a score of 0 for a simple algorithm that should have high provability.

bug_reports:
  - bug:
      id: 1
      title: "`ruchy compile` fails on a documented working example"
      steps_to_reproduce:
        - "Run `ruchy compile /home/noah/src/rosetta-ruchy/examples/algorithms/001-fibonacci/implementations/ruchy/fibonacci.ruchy --output /home/noah/src/rosetta-ruchy/fibonacci_test`"
      expected_behavior: "The command should successfully compile the file into an executable."
      actual_behavior: "The command fails with a Rust compilation error: `error[E0317]: `if` may be missing an `else` clause`."
  - bug:
      id: 2
      title: "`ruchy runtime` provides minimal output"
      steps_to_reproduce:
        - "Run `ruchy runtime /home/noah/src/rosetta-ruchy/examples/algorithms/001-fibonacci/implementations/ruchy/fibonacci.ruchy`"
      expected_behavior: "The command should output detailed performance metrics, including complexity, as shown in the README.md."
      actual_behavior: "The command only prints the file path and a header."
  - bug:
      id: 3
      title: "`ruchy provability` gives a zero score for a simple algorithm"
      steps_to_reproduce:
        - "Run `ruchy provability /home/noah/src/rosetta-ruchy/examples/algorithms/001-fibonacci/implementations/ruchy/fibonacci.ruchy`"
      expected_behavior: "The command should return a high provability score, as indicated in the README.md."
      actual_behavior: "The command returns `Provability Score: 0.0/100`."
