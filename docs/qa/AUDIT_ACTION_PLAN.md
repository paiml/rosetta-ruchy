## Week 2: Structural Improvements (Sprint 42B)

### Ticket 5: Test Coverage (3 days)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: Ready

**Current**: 39.51%
**Target**: 80%
**Gap**: 40.49%

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Tests (1 day)**
- [ ] Add tests to `mcp-server/` (target: 85% coverage)
  - API endpoint tests
  - Code translation tests
  - Error handling tests
  - Health check tests
- [ ] Add tests to `harness/` (target: 85% coverage)
  - Statistical runner tests
  - Benchmark framework tests
  - Result aggregation tests

**Phase 2: Script Tests (1 day)**
- [ ] Add tests to `scripts/` where applicable
  - Test benchmark-runner.sh with fixtures
  - Test pre-commit-hook.sh behavior
  - Test utility scripts

**Phase 3: Integration Tests (1 day)**
- [ ] Add end-to-end MCP server tests
- [ ] Add full benchmark pipeline tests
- [ ] Add CI/CD workflow tests

**Phase 4: Enforcement**
- [ ] Add `cargo tarpaulin` to CI/CD
- [ ] Set 80% threshold in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Document coverage requirements in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

**Acceptance**:
- `cargo tarpaulin` reports ≥80% coverage
- CI/CD enforces coverage threshold
- All critical paths tested

**Deliverable**: 80%+ test coverage + enforcement

---

### Ticket 6: Complexity Refactoring (1 week)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: Ready

**Current**:
- Max Cognitive Complexity: 63
- Max Cyclomatic Complexity: 23
- Target: ≤20

**Phase 1: Analysis (2 hours)**
- [ ] Run `make analyze-complexity` with detailed output
- [ ] Identify all functions with complexity >20
- [ ] Export to `reports/complexity-refactoring-targets.md`
- [ ] Prioritize by impact (high-traffic code first)

**Phase 2: Kaizen Refactoring (5 days)**
Apply Toyota Way Kaizen loop to each function:

1. **Identify Target**: Function with complexity >20
2. **Break Down**: Extract smaller, focused functions
3. **Test**: Ensure behavior unchanged
4. **Verify**: Confirm complexity ≤20
5. **Repeat**: Next function

**Refactoring Techniques**:
- Extract method
- Split conditionals
- Introduce parameter objects
- Replace nested loops with iterators
- Apply single responsibility principle

**Phase 3: Enforcement (1 hour)**
- [ ] Add complexity check to pre-commit hook
- [ ] Set threshold at 20 in `roadmap.yaml`
- [ ] Document complexity policy in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

**Acceptance**:
- All functions have complexity ≤20
- Pre-commit hook enforces threshold
- CI/CD validates complexity

**Deliverable**: Complexity ≤20 + enforcement

## Blocked Items (Waiting for Ruchy Team)

### Performance Benchmarking (ROSETTA-414)
**Status**: BLOCKED - Missing `.parse::<T>()` in Ruchy 3.78.0

**Infrastructure Ready**:
- ✅ `scripts/benchmark-runner.sh` (190 lines)
- ✅ `reports/performance/BENCHMARKING_PLAN.md` (200+ lines)
- ✅ 5 algorithms selected and verified
- ✅ Rust compilation optimized

**Blocker**: Cannot parse CLI arguments for parameterized benchmarks

**When Unblocked**:
- Can execute full benchmark suite immediately
- Estimated: 1 day to run and generate report
- Will provide empirical performance data

**Action**: Monitor Ruchy releases for `.parse::<T>()` support

---

### fmt Tool Fix
**Status**: BLOCKED - P0 bug in Ruchy 3.78.0

**Issue**: fmt outputs AST debug representation, destroys files

**Workaround**: Only use `--check` flag

**When Fixed**:
- Can format all 126 examples
- Can add fmt to quality gates
- Will achieve 100% fmt pass rate

**Action**: Ruchy team needs to implement pretty-printer

---
