# Gemini QA Audit Report - Oct 14, 2025

This report audits the claims made in the `README.md` file of the Rosetta Ruchy project.

## 1. Performance Claims

*   **Claim:** Ruchy has performance parity with Rust (within 5% for CPU tasks).
    *   **Status in `README.md`:** ðŸš§ In Development
    *   **Audit Finding:** UNVERIFIED. The `README.md` correctly states this is a development goal. No performance benchmark results were found to verify progress.
*   **Claim:** Ruchy is 10-50x faster than Python.
    *   **Status in `README.md`:** ðŸš§ In Development
    *   **Audit Finding:** UNVERIFIED. The `README.md` correctly states this is a development goal. No performance benchmark results were found to verify progress.

## 2. Ruchy Toolchain

*   **Claim:** A `ruchy` binary (v1.7.0) exists with the following commands: `check`, `runtime`, `provability`, `score`, `ast`, `optimize`, `prove`, `mcp`, `quality-gate`.
    *   **Audit Finding:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED. The `ruchy` binary exists and all claimed subcommands are present. However, the version is `3.78.0`, not `1.7.0` as claimed in the `README.md`.

## 3. Toyota Way Quality System

*   **Claim:** Zero SATD Policy (no TODO, FIXME, HACK).
    *   **Audit Finding:** FALSE. Numerous `TODO` comments were found in both `.ruchy` and `.rs` files.
*   **Claim:** All functions have cognitive complexity <= 20.
    *   **Audit Finding:** FALSE. The `pmat analyze complexity` command reported a maximum cognitive complexity of 63 and a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 23, both of which are greater than the claimed threshold of 20.
*   **Claim:** Test coverage is >= 80%.
    *   **Audit Finding:** FALSE. `cargo tarpaulin` reported a test coverage of `39.51%`, which is below the claimed threshold of 80%.
*   **Claim:** Zero lint warnings.
    *   **Audit Finding:** FALSE. `make lint` reported numerous warnings and errors from `ruchy lint`.
*   **Claim:** Security scans are performed.
    *   **Audit Finding:** FALSE. `cargo audit` reported one vulnerability and three warnings.

## 4. Project Status

*   **Claim:** Phase 3 (Data Science Migration) is complete.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The `examples/data-science` directory contains 12 examples, and the files within these directories have `v189` in their names, supporting the claim of migration to v1.89.0.
*   **Claim:** Phase 2 (Multi-Language MCP Server) is complete.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The `mcp-server` was successfully built and started. The health check endpoint returned a healthy status.
*   **Claim:** Phase 1 (Algorithm Examples) is complete.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The `examples/algorithms` directory contains at least 22 algorithm examples, and the `test-results.json` file shows that all algorithm examples are passing tests.
*   **Claim:** Phase 0 (Foundation Infrastructure) is complete.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The project has a clear repository structure, a Cargo workspace, a statistical runner, and CI/CD pipelines. The Toyota Way methodology is integrated into the project's documentation and `Makefile`. However, it should be noted that many of the quality gates are currently failing.

## 5. MCP Server

*   **Claim:** A real-time code translation service exists.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The `mcp-server` was successfully built and started, and the health check endpoint responded successfully. The `mcp-server/README.md` provides detailed documentation for the server's API.

## 6. PMAT Integration

*   **Claim:** Integration with PMAT for advanced quality analysis.
    *   **Audit Finding:** VERIFIED. The `Makefile` contains several targets that use the `pmat` tool for quality analysis, such as `complexity`, `analyze-complexity`, and `analyze-debt`. The `pmat` tool was successfully used to perform complexity analysis.
