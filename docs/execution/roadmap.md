## Sprint-Based Execution Plan

### 📋 Sprint Process (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Every Sprint:
1. Update INTEGRATION.md with current Ruchy version
2. Test verification tools (ruchy check/runtime/provability/score)
3. Implement with scientific rigor using documented patterns
4. Collect empirical data and formal proofs
5. Document any feature limitations or workarounds
6. Commit and push to GitHub with version tracking
7. Create scientific report with reproducible results

# Sprint Duration: 2-3 days
# Deliverable: Complete, version-tracked algorithm validation
```

### 🔄 Version Management Protocol
```bash
# When Ruchy version updates:
1. Update INTEGRATION.md header with new version
2. Re-test all verification tools on existing algorithms  
3. Test previously limited features (format strings, assert!, etc.)
4. Create new algorithm versions using newly available features
5. Maintain backward compatibility with previous versions
6. Update scientific reports with version-specific results
7. Provide feedback to Ruchy team on resolved/new issues

# File Naming Convention:
algorithm_v18.ruchy  # Ruchy 1.8.0 compatible version
algorithm_v19.ruchy  # Ruchy 1.9.0 with new features (future)
algorithm.ruchy      # Latest version (symlink or copy of newest)
```
