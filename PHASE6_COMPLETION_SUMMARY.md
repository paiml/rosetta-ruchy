fun test_all_branches() {
    let _result1: i32 = algorithm(base_case);     // Base case branch
    let _result2: i32 = algorithm(recursive_case); // Recursive branch
    // Verification logic...
}

// Loop Coverage Pattern  
fun test_loop_iterations() {
    let _zero_iter = algorithm(0);    // Zero iterations
    let _one_iter = algorithm(1);     // Single iteration  
    let _multi_iter = algorithm(10);  // Multiple iterations
    // Coverage verification...
}

// Property Coverage Pattern
fun test_mathematical_properties() {
    // Test invariants, commutativity, identity properties
    // Mathematical verification of algorithm correctness
}
```
