notes: |
  This is a Test-Driven Validation (TDD) project where every Ruchy implementation
  is automatically tested, formally verified, and quality-scored.

  The project serves as both:
  1. Scientific validation of Ruchy's capabilities (formal verification, complexity analysis)
  2. Comprehensive benchmark suite comparing Ruchy to Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, C

  Quality is built-in, not bolted-on. Zero tolerance for untested code or SATD comments.

  Based on patterns from ruchy-book project (https://github.com/paiml/ruchy-book)
  which uses Test-Driven Documentation with 100% example verification.
