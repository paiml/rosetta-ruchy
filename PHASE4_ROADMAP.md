## Success Criteria

### Per Sprint
- [ ] TDD methodology with tests first
- [ ] Quality score â‰¥0.85 (B+ or higher)
- [ ] Provability score â‰¥75%
- [ ] Mathematical proofs for core properties
- [ ] Performance within 10% of reference implementations
- [ ] Complete documentation and reproducibility

### Phase 4 Goals
- [ ] Demonstrate Ruchy for advanced AI applications
- [ ] Prove deep learning algorithm correctness
- [ ] Validate systems programming capabilities
- [ ] Establish quantum computing foundations
- [ ] Create blockchain verification patterns

## Technical Challenges

### Expected Limitations
1. **Matrix Operations**: Integer-only arithmetic requires scaling
2. **Floating Point**: Deep learning typically needs float precision
3. **GPU Acceleration**: No native GPU support in Ruchy
4. **Memory Management**: Large models may hit limits
5. **Recursion Depth**: Deep networks need iterative approaches

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Scale integers for decimal precision
2. **Quantization**: Use integer approximations for weights
3. **Mini-Batching**: Process smaller chunks iteratively
4. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse allocated structures
5. **Loop Unrolling**: Convert recursion to iteration

## Verification Focus
